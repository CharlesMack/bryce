P.O.P.S. — Bryce Pocket Player

A ultra‑light, offline‑friendly MP4 player designed for the P.O.P.S. ecosystem. Runs anywhere a browser runs — desktop or mobile — and ships as a single‑page, zero‑dependency AppDrop you can own, host, and remix.

✨ Features

Pocket‑sized, one‑page app — drop it on any static host or open from local disk.

Offline‑first — fully works without internet; optional Service Worker cache.

Drag‑and‑drop MP4 — or use the built‑in file picker; no uploads, no tracking.

Mobile friendly — touch controls, orientation awareness, PWA installable.

Keyboard controls — space to play/pause, arrows to seek, F for fullscreen.

Picture‑in‑Picture — pop the video out and roam the OS.

Scrub bar + timecode — precise seeking with hover/drag.

Quick zoom & fit — scale video to fit, fill, or 1:1 pixel view.

Remember last — optionally recalls the most recent file and playback state (localStorage).

P.O.P.S.‑ready — clean embed API so you can mount it inside panels or AppDrops.

Privacy‑first: all files load directly from the user’s device. Nothing leaves the browser.
